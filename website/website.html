    <h4>
        The Telugu states names of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were the historical popular ethnonym for the Telugu ethno-region as a whole before the States Reorganisation Act in 1956 due to which the Telugu states modern defined boundaries exist. Prior to the Indian Independence Act, the present Telugu states were part of the British suzerain Hyderabad state of the Nizam and Madras Presidency of the British Crown.
